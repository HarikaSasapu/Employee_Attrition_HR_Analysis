## ‚ú® About the Project

Employee attrition analytics is a data-driven approach to address employee turnover by:
- **Identifying patterns**: Understanding who is leaving and when.
- **Exploring root causes**: Analyzing why employees leave and what could prevent it.
- **Predicting attrition risk**: Building predictive models to forecast turnover.
- **Designing retention strategies**: Leveraging insights to retain top talent and improve organizational stability.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of remote work, understanding and addressing employee attrition has become critical for businesses to thrive in the global market.

Employee attrition analytics is specifically focused on identifying why employees voluntarily leave, what might have prevented them from leaving, and how we can use data to predict attrition risk.

Employee attrition analytics is specifically focused on identifying why employees voluntarily leave, what might have prevented them from leaving, and how we can use data to predict attrition risk. Most importantly, this type of employee predictive analytics can be used to help organizations understand and design the interventions that will be most effective in reducing unwanted attrition.


Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‚Äòshow me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition‚Äô or ‚Äòcompare average monthly income by education and attrition‚Äô. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.
